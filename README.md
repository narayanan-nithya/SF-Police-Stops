Team Members: Alex, Nithya, Francisco, Tran

Github Repository: https://github.com/alexrayperry/SF-Police-Stops

Project Description/Outline: In this project, we will collect Police traffic Stops/arrests made in the year 2015 in San Francisco City based on different races namely(Black, White, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander) and map that on the SF area using leaflet. We will be using pandas to clean up the data in the desired json format and exporting it to MongoDB. Using Flask , we will access the database and routing it to HTML pages to display the visualization. The HTML/CSS page will let users filter data to visualize. Final visualization dashboard will include a leaflet map with data plotted,pie charts and bar graphs on arrest made count and stops count.

Research Questions to Answer: Which races are arrested more?
